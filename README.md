## Installation
First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/getzola/hyde.git
```
and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "hyde"
```

## Folder tree
This theme expects all the articles to be in the root of the folder. The expected `content` folder tree is as follow
```
├───content
│   │   _index.md
│   ├───content_1
│   │       content_1_image.png
│   │       index.md
│   ├───content_2
│   │       content_2_image.png
│   │       index.md
│   └───about
│       │   _index.md
│       └───about
│               about_image.png
│               index.md
```
## Options

### Sidebar menu
Set a field in `extra` with a key of `hyde_links`:
```toml
[extra]
hyde_links = [
    {url = "https://google.com", name = "Google.com"},
    {url = "https://google.fr", name = "Google.fr"},
]
```
Each link needs to have a `url` and a `name`.

### Sticky sidebar content
By default Hyde ships with a sidebar that affixes it's content to the bottom of the sidebar. You can optionally disable this by setting `hyde_sticky` to false in your `config.toml`.

### Themes
Hyde ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

There are eight themes available at this time.

To use a theme, set the `hyde_theme` field in `config.toml` to any of the themes name:

```toml
[extra]
hyde_theme = "theme-base-08"
```

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/poole/hyde/blob/master/public/css/hyde.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.

### Reverse layout

Hyde's page orientation can be reversed by setting `hyde_reverse` to `true` in the `config.toml`.
